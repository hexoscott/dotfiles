- dnsmasq - via homebrew, setup to receive on .internal and .local
- alt-tab https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app
- emetttap - from their site https://emmetapp.com/

## things to do:
### dnsmasq on mac
- sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver
- create two files with the contents 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' at /etc/resolver/internal and /etc/resolver/local
- the above will point .internal and .local through the local dnsmasq DNS server
- edit /opt/homebrew/etc/dnsmasq.conf and add address=/internal/127.0.0.1 and address=/local/127.0.0.1
- dnsmasq will now send all .local and .internal addresses to your machine
